        <p>Ever wake up to find that your favorite artist’s commission slot has vanished? We know how frustrating it is to wait for months 
          only to miss your chance because the slot filled up while you were asleep.</p>
        <p>Worry no more! Skeb Sniper levels the playing field for Western users by automating the commission request process for Japanese 
          artists who often open slots while you sleep. By acting only when Skeb sends an email notification, Skeb Sniper ensures you never 
          miss that coveted commission!</p>
