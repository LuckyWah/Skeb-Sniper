                My name is カソラ (Kasora), a fursuiter and Skeb commissioner. I am the solo developer for Skeb Sniper, 
                a private commercial software, as well as the owner, developer, and manager of 
                <a href="https://kasorashibainu.com" target="_blank">kasorashibainu.com</a>.

                Since I live in the United States, I often missed the opportunity to commission artists on Skeb because of the 
                time difference. In my case, I had been waiting for over two years to commission 
                <a href="https://twitter.com/night_owl_zZ" target="_blank">やふくろ (yafukuro)</a>, only to realize that their 
                slots usually opened in the afternoon in Japan, which is early morning for me.
                By the time I was awake, their commissions were already closed. Since they only open two to three times a year, 
                I never really had a chance to commission them, and I just couldn't compete with commissioners in the same time zone 
                as the artist.
                I also learned that a friend of mine woke up at 3 AM just to send a request to their favorite artists 
                because their slots always fill up in a couple of minutes, so I created Skeb Sniper to solve this problem for myself 
                and my friends who also struggle to secure a slot. Now with Skeb Sniper, whether we're sleeping, in a meeting, 
                or traveling, we can always send a request to our favorite artists without disrupting whatever we're doing.

                Finally, I would like to thank the amazing artists who made the drawings for me on this website. The icon and background 
                were illustrated by <a href="https://twitter.com/tooboe_huusuke" target="_blank">とおぼえふうすけ (tooboefuusuke)</a>, 
                and the portrait on the right was created by <a href="https://twitter.com/yakinikuinu" target="_blank">がみ (gami)</a>.
