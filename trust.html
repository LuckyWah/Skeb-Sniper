            <p>
                Our software is designed with user privacy and security in mind, and we are not just paying lip service.  
                If you are privacy-conscious, you do not have to take our words blindly.  
                You are the judge, and you decide whether Skeb Sniper is safe.  
                You can verify our claims regarding privacy protection by following these simple tests.
            </p>
    
            <h3>1. Your Twitter Credentials Are Never Transferred and Only Stored Locally</h3>
            <p>
                You can verify that Skeb Sniper never transmits your Twitter credentials and encrypts them locally:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Launch Skeb Sniper. The software will perform an online license check. Note that the program checks the license every hour, so complete this test within one hour.</li>
                <li>Enter a random Twitter username and password.</li>
                <li>Block all internet access for Skeb Sniper using your firewall or network monitor.</li>
                <li>Create a task using the random Twitter credentials.</li>
                <li>Locate the encrypted credentials in a text file named "user info" inside Skeb Sniper’s installation directory.</li>
                <li>Open the encrypted file with a text editor. You will see unreadable encrypted data. The program will not crash or throw errors, because there is no code attempting to transmit your credentials.</li>
                <li>Monitor your network activity. You will see no outgoing connections during password entry.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>This confirms that password is handled locally without transmitting any sensitive information.</p>
    
            <h3>2. We Use User-Specific and Machine-Specific Encryption</h3>
            <p>
                You can verify that even if the encrypted credentials file is stolen, it cannot be decrypted using another user account on the same machine or a different machine:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Copy all files in your working directory, including the encrypted user information file, to another user account on the same machine or to a different machine.</li>
                <li>Launch Skeb Sniper. The software will automatically attempt to decrypt the file.</li>
                <li>Observe that no user information is shown in Skeb Sniper. This indicates that decryption has failed, and the program has deleted any files it cannot decrypt 
                    because the encryption key is different.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>This confirms that Skeb Sniper’s encryption is tied to both your specific device and user account, preventing unauthorized decryption even if the file is stolen.</p>
    
            <h3>3. Our Software Processes Emails Locally Without Transmission</h3>
            <p>
                You can verify that Skeb Sniper processes email notifications locally and never transmits your email data to our server:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Launch Skeb Sniper normally. This step requires contacting our server once to check your license. Complete this within one hour.</li>
                <li>Block all connections to our server <span>kasorashibainu.com</span> using your firewall.</li>
                <li>Send a test email to your own Gmail account.</li>
                <li>Observe that Skeb Sniper still detects the new email correctly in the log, even with our server blocked.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>This confirms that Skeb Sniper does not transmit your Gmail emails or metadata externally. Email notifications are processed entirely on your device.</p>
    
            <h4>
                By performing these tests, you can be confident that you have absolute control over your own credentials and that your emails are never read by us.
