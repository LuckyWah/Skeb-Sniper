        <h2>Terms of Service</h2>
        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 04/16/2025</p>
        <h3>1. Acceptance of Terms</h3>
        <p>
          By using Skeb Sniper ("the software"), you ("the user") agree to these Terms of Service, including any future amendments or modifications.
        </p>
        
        <h3>2. Modifications to Terms of Service</h3>
        <p>
        If we need to make any changes, we will notify you by email. If you no longer agree with the updated terms, you may cancel your subscription.
        </p>        

        <h3>3. Subscription</h3>
        <p>
          Skeb Sniper is offered on a subscription basis. Upon subscribing, you authorize automated payments through our designated 
          payment processor (i.e., PayPal). Your subscription will automatically renew unless you cancel it. Once you cancel your 
          subscription, your license will be deactivated and you will no longer be able to use the software.
        </p>

        <h3>4. Change of Price</h3>
        <p>
            If we need to change the price of your subscription, we will notify you by email at least 1 month in advance. This gives you time 
            to review the changes and cancel your subscription if you do not agree with the new pricing.
        </p>        
        
        <h3>5. License</h3>
        <p>
            This software is licensed, not sold. Upon successful subscription, you are granted a non-exclusive, non-transferable 
            license to use the software solely for its intended purpose of monitoring artists on Skeb. This license is tied to the email 
            address used for your payment via PayPal and remains valid as long as your subscription is active and in good standing.
        </p>          
        
        <h3>6. Restrictions</h3>
        <p>
          You agree not to: 
          <ul>
            <li>Copy, redistribute, or share the software with any third party;</li>
            <li>Modify, adapt, decompile, disassemble, reverse-engineer, or create derivative works from the software;</li>
            <li>Monetize the software or any of its components without prior written consent from the developer;</li>
            <li>Use the software in any manner that violates applicable laws or infringes upon the rights of any third party.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        
        <h3>7. Disclaimer of Liability</h3>
        <p>
            The software is provided "as is." The developer is not responsible for any damages or losses resulting from 
            the software being unusable.
        </p>        
        
        <h3>8. Refund Policy</h3>
        <p>
          Currently, as a solo developer, we do not have the capacity to review refund requests. Therefore, all subscription 
          fees for Skeb Sniper are non-refundable. Once a payment is processed and access to the software is granted, 
          no refunds will be issued unless we are legally required to do so or if we are unable to provide the service.
          If we are unable to deliver the service, we will refund the applicable monthly rate. 
          For example, if you paid $10 for a monthly plan, you will receive a $10 refund. If you subscribed during 
          a promotional period at a discounted rate such as $5 per month, you will be refunded that discounted amount, which is $5. 
          For yearly plans, the refund will be based on the equivalent monthly rate at the time:  
          if the current rate is $10 per month, you will receive $10.
          Becasue of our no-refund policy, we advise you to test the software during the 30-day trial period.
          By subscribing, you acknowledge that you have read and understood this refund policy.
        </p>

        <h3>9. Possible Discontinuation of Service</h3>
        <p>
          In the event of unforeseen circumstances, such as changes to Skeb's Terms of Service prohibiting the use of this tool, 
          or if Skeb discontinues email notifications, we may temporarily or permanently halt the service. We reserve the right to 
          discontinue the service and will refund the applicable amount as outlined in our refund policy. 
          All affected users will be notified via email.
        </p>        
                
        <h3>10. Violation of Terms of Service</h3> 
        <p>
            Any violation of the Terms of Service will result in the revocation of your license without a refund.
        </p>
