        <h2>Terms of Service</h2>
        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 03/25/2025</p>
        <h3>1. Acceptance of Terms</h3>
        <p>
          By using Skeb Sniper ("the software"), you ("the user") agree to these Terms of Service, including any future amendments or modifications.
        </p>
        
        <h3>2. Modifications to Terms of Service</h3>
        <p>
        If we need to make any changes, we will notify you by email. If you no longer agree with the updated terms, you may cancel your subscription.
        </p>        

        <h3>3. Subscription</h3>
        <p>
          Skeb Sniper is offered on a subscription basis. Upon subscribing, you authorize automated payments through our designated 
          payment processor (i.e., PayPal). The initial subscription includes an introductory period at a discounted rate ($6 per 
          month for the first 3 months), after which the standard rate of $10 per month will apply. You can also opt for a yearly subscription 
          at the standard rate of $100, which includes a $20 discount compared to paying monthly at the standard rate. Your subscription 
          will automatically renew unless you cancel it. Once you cancel your subscription, your license will be deactivated and you 
          will no longer be able to use the software.
        </p>

        <h3>4. Change of Price</h3>
        <p>
            If we need to change the price of your subscription, we will notify you by email at least 1 month in advance. This gives you time 
            to review the changes and cancel your subscription if you do not agree with the new pricing.
        </p>        
        
        <h3>5. License</h3>
        <p>
            This software is licensed, not sold. Upon successful subscription, you are granted a non-exclusive, non-transferable 
            license to use the software solely for its intended purpose of monitoring artists on Skeb. This license is tied to the email 
            address used for your payment via PayPal and remains valid as long as your subscription is active and in good standing.
        </p>          
        
        <h3>6. Restrictions</h3>
        <p>
          You agree not to: 
          <ul>
            <li>Copy, redistribute, or share the software with any third party;</li>
            <li>Modify, adapt, decompile, disassemble, reverse-engineer, or create derivative works from the software;</li>
            <li>Monetize the software or any of its components without prior written consent from the developer;</li>
            <li>Use the software in any manner that violates applicable laws or infringes upon the rights of any third party.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        
        <h3>7. Disclaimer of Liability</h3>
        <p>
            The software is provided "as is." The developer is not responsible for any damages or losses resulting from 
            the software being unusable.
        </p>        
        
        <h3>8. Refund Policy</h3>
        <p>
          Currently, as a solo developer, we do not have the capacity to review refund requests. Therefore, all subscription 
          fees for Skeb Sniper are non-refundable. Once a payment is processed and access to our software is granted, no refunds will be 
          issued unless required by law. We advise you to test the software during the 7-day trial period.
          By subscribing, you acknowledge that you have read and understood this refund policy.
        </p>
                
        <h3>9. Violation of Terms of Service</h3> 
        <p>
            Any violation of the Terms of Service will result in the revocation of your license without a refund.
        </p>
