    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <h3>Security and Privacy</h3>
    <details>
      <summary>My Windows PC flags the application as a security concern. Is this application a security threat?</summary>
      <p>No, this happens because Windows does not trust unsigned executables and may flag them as potential malware. 
        The warning appears because our executable lacks a valid certificate authority (CA), 
        which requires a costly certification process that is not necessary for this software. 
        You can manually trust the executable, as it is safe and not malware.</p>          
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>My antivirus software detected the application as a trojan. Is this true?</summary>
      <p>No, this is a false positive. You can manually mark our software as trusted, as we have no reason to distribute a trojan, 
        nor would it be legal to do so. If you still have concerns, you may request a refund.</p>    
    </details>  

    <details>
      <summary>Are my Twitter credentials safe?</summary>
      <p>Yes, your Twitter credentials are highly secure because they are encrypted using a machine-specific and user-specific key.
        Our application features enterprise-level security as the encryption key is derived using PBKDF2 with SHA-256 and a 16-byte 
        user-specific salt at each runtime, and this key encrypts your data using AES-128 in CBC mode with HMAC-SHA256 authentication, 
        ensuring that only your user account and your device can decrypt the stored data. This makes any attempt to steal your 
        credentials remotely impossible.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Do you collect any sensitive data from us?</summary>
      <p>No, we never collect any sensitive data from you, including your Gmail account or Twitter credentials. We use enterprise-level 
        encryption to protect your sensitive data, which is then securely stored on your device. To learn how your data is used, 
        please see our Privacy Policy. Note that while we do not store any sensitive data, we do store the email address of the PayPal 
        account used for your purchase. This email is used for license activation and verification.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>When I try to authenticate using Gmail OAuth, I get a warning that says Google hasn't verified this app. How do I grant 
        access to the application?</summary>
      <p>
        Our application requires read-only access to Gmail, which triggers Google's security verification process. Unfortunately, 
        Google mandates a CASA (Cloud Application Security Assessment) verification for applications requesting sensitive scopes, such as 
        the Read-Only scope. CASA verification is a <strong>very costly</strong> security assessment that must be completed annually, 
        and we currently do not have sufficient funds to cover the verification cost.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because of this, our application cannot be verified and Google will always display a warning when you try to use it. To proceed, 
        click on <u>Advanced</u> and select <u>Go to Skeb Sniper (unsafe)</u>. If you want to learn how your data is processed, 
        we encourage you to read our Privacy Policy. If you are not comfortable using our software, you may request a refund. 
        Once the refund is processed, your usage privileges will be revoked.
      </p>      
    </details>

    <h3>Licensing</h3>
    <details>   
      <summary>How does licensing work?</summary>  
      <p>After purchasing, users receive a unique license key, which must be entered with the email you used to make the purchase 
        when running the program for the first time.  
         Once activated, the license key is stored in the working directory. The software performs an online license check 
         every time it is used. The software cannot be run offline because every run needs an online license check.</p>  
      <p>Note that each license can only be activated once per user. If you want to use both the Windows and Linux versions,  
         you must manually copy your license key file into the working directory of the other version.</p>  
    </details>    

    <details>  
      <summary>What email address is required to activate my license?</summary>  
      <p>The email you should enter to activate your license is the email address of your PayPal account used to purchase this software.</p>  
    </details>    

    <details>  
      <summary>Can I share my license with others?</summary>  
      <p>No, sharing your license is strictly prohibited by our Terms of Service. Only the original purchaser is authorized 
        to use the license. If unauthorized use is detected, we reserve the right to revoke the offender's license without 
        issuing a refund.</p>
    </details>

    <details>  
      <summary>Will my license expire?</summary>  
      <p>No, once you purchase lifetime access, your license will never expire. You will also have access to future 
        updates when they become available. We'll notify you by email when future updates are available on our website.</p>  
    </details>    

    <h3>Application Requirements</h3>
    <details>
      <summary>What are the requirements for running this application?</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>Ensure you have sufficient Skeb points for the request or that your bank does not require authentication.
             Otherwise, the program will fail to submit your request.</li>
          <li>Make sure you are using your Gmail account to receive emails from Skeb. 
            If not, update your email to your Gmail account in your Skeb account settings.</li>
          <li>Confirm that you have enabled notifications for the artist. 
            If not, visit the artist's Skeb page and click "Notify on seeking started."</li>
          <li>Test the program and successfully activate the Gmail listener before running the task in the background.</li>
          <li>When running the task in the background, ensure the Gmail listener is activated successfully.</li>
      </ul>        
    </details>

    <details> 
      <summary>Can I run this application on my own PC?</summary>  
      <p>Yes, you can run the application on your PC, but it is recommended to use a server instead. Running it on a 
          personal computer is not ideal because most users cannot keep their PC running 24/7, and doing so is not good 
          for your hardware.</p>            
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Am I required to enter my Twitter credentials?</summary>
      <p>Yes, the program requires your credentials to log in. While they're not always needed, it's safest to have them available. 
        When submitting a request, the program will first try to use cookies if you have already logged into your Firefox account.
        If that fails, it will fall back to your Twitter credentials.</p>          
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>I do not use Gmail to receive emails from Skeb. Can I not use Gmail?</summary>
      <p>Unfortunately, Skeb Sniper currently only works with Gmail. Each email API is different, and supporting multiple email APIs 
        would require significant time and effort. Since this software is developed and maintained by a single developer, we currently 
        lack the resources to support additional email APIs. We chose the Gmail API because it's the most popular choice. 
        If you prefer not to use Gmail, this program will not function as intended.</p>
    </details>

    <h3>Application Functionality</h3>
    <details>
      <summary>How does this program work?</summary>
      <p>Skeb Sniper is an email driven program, meaning that only when you receive an email from Skeb stating that the artist is open 
        for requests, the program will send a request to the artist.</p>          
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>What does "Run in Background" in task manager do?</summary>
      <p>You use "Run in Background" when you genuinely want to send a request to the artist. 
        Do <strong>not</strong> use it for testing because no fake email will be sent to you to trigger the automation tool. 
        Automation will only be triggered by the email sent from Skeb. When you click on "Run in Background," 
        the program starts a background process that runs continuously, allowing you to safely disconnect from your server. 
        On Windows, it uses a Windows service, while on Linux, it runs as a daemon managed by supervisord, so you need admin/root privileges to run. 
        The background process automatically shuts down when no tasks are running.</p>          
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>You advertised the application as "sending an instant request." How fast is "instant"?</summary>
      <p>According to the developer's tests on Windows and Linux servers, using the "Run in Background" feature (not "Test Run," 
        which may take longer to distinguish scenarios), from the time the artist opens requests on Skeb to the time when 
        the application successfully sends a request, it takes about 8 seconds. However, the response time may vary depending on factors 
        such as server latency on Skeb and Google, computer performance. If no errors occur, your request 
        should be sent well under 1 minute.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Does sending a request through this application guarantee that the artist will accept my commission?</summary>
      <p>No, this application is designed to automatically send a request to the artist, replacing the need for manual submission, 
        so you don’t have to wake up at ungodly hours to send the request yourself. However, whether your request will be accepted 
        depends on the artist and is beyond this program’s control.</p>
    </details>

    <h3>Tutorial</h3>
    <details>
      <summary>How do I test the program?</summary>
      <p>You can test the program by clicking on "Test Run." The program will send you an automated email, 
        which will trigger the automation tool to send a request to the artist. 
        We recommend selecting an artist currently open for requests to confirm that the program can log into your account. 
        If login fails, ensure that Two-Factor Authentication is disabled on Twitter. If you prefer not to send a request right now, 
        set the amount to a value below the minimum requirement (e.g., 500). If test run fails, please contact the developer.</p>          
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>How do I confirm that the program is listening for my emails?</summary>
      <p>You can verify this by checking the log file named "GmailListener.log" in your working directory after running a task.  
        If you see "Gmail authentication successful!", "Gmail Watch Started!", and "Listening for messages...", 
        the program is actively listening for new emails.</p>
    </details>      

    <details>
      <summary>I am running a task for an artist that is currently open in background, but the program does not send a request to the artist. 
        Why is that?</summary>
      <p>Skeb Sniper is an email driven program, so if the artist is currently open, no email will be sent to you from Skeb, 
        thus nothing will trigger the automation tool and no request will be sent. 
        Only use "Run in Background" for artists that are currently closed and ensure that you have reserved email notification from Skeb.</p>          
    </details>

    <h3>Server</h3>
    <details>   
      <summary>Are the servers for this website and software managed by you?</summary>  
      <p>Yes, we manage a webhook server for email notifications and a backend server for this website, maintained by 
        the developer. If you experience issues such as coupons not working or a browser not launching after 
        clicking "Test Run," please contact the developer. A webhook server outage may affect email notifications 
        and backend server outage would impact coupon validation.</p>          
    </details>   

    <details> 
      <summary>Do I need to run the application on a server?</summary>  
      <p>Running the application on a server is not required, but we strongly recommend running it on a server because it is a 
        long-running program. If you choose to use a server, you will need to set up the server yourself, as we do not provide server hosting.</p>        
    </details>

    <details>  
      <summary>How do I choose the right server to run the application?</summary>  
      <p>Your choice of server depends on your technical expertise and budget:</p>  
      <ul>  
          <li><strong>Windows Version:</strong> Good for users with little to no technical experience in computers as  
            Windows provides a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) that handles all tasks without command-line operations.</li>  
            <li><strong>Linux Version:</strong> Recommended for users with technical expertise seeking a cost-effective 
              solution. Linux servers are significantly cheaper than Windows servers, but a basic understanding of 
              Linux systems is required to use them effectively.</li>                  
      </ul>  
    </details>      

    <details> 
      <summary>What are the minimum server requirements?</summary>  
      <p>Assuming no resource-intensive programs are running on your server, the minimum requirements for running the program are:</p>
      <ul>  
        <li><strong>Linux:</strong> 2GB of RAM and a 10GB persistent disk.</li>  
        <li><strong>Windows:</strong> 4GB of RAM and a 50GB persistent disk.</li>  
      </ul>  
      <p>Windows requires more RAM and disk space because it includes a built-in graphical user interface (GUI).</p>  
    </details>    

    <h3>Linux-Specific Questions</h3>
    <details>  
      <summary>Why do you offer a Linux version of the software?</summary>  
      <p>Our application is a long-running program that continuously monitors emails from Skeb, therefore it is better to run 
        the application on a server than on your own PC. Most people are familiar with Windows, but due to high Microsoft licensing costs, 
        a Linux server is a much more affordable alternative.</p>  
      <p>For example, on Google Cloud Platform as of March 18, 2025, running the program on Linux requires 2GB of RAM 
        and a 10GB persistent disk, costing approximately <strong>$13</strong> per month. In contrast, a Windows setup requires 
        4GB of RAM and a 50GB persistent disk, costing <strong>$63</strong> per month. This means that using a Linux server reduces 
        costs to about <strong>20%</strong> of a Windows server.</p>  
      <p>Therefore, Linux is the preferred choice for server deployments due to its cost efficiency. However, if you are not 
        familiar with Linux, we recommend using Windows, as Linux requires more technical knowledge to set up and manage.
      </p>  
    </details>    

    <details>  
      <summary>Do you have a tutorial on running the program on a Linux server?</summary>  
      <p>Currently, we do not provide a tutorial for running our software on a Linux server, as we expect Linux users to be 
        familiar with basic commands and GUI forwarding. If you are unsure how to set up GUI forwarding, there are video 
        tutorials available on YouTube that can guide you through the process. If you are unable to get GUI forwarding to 
        work, consider using the Windows version instead.</p>  
    </details>    

    <details>
      <summary>How do I run the application on a Linux server?</summary>
      <p>Before running the application, make sure Docker is installed and running on your Linux server. Download the shell scripts 
        <code>setup.sh</code> and <code>run.sh</code> from the Purchase tab.</p>
      <p>To set up the container, run:</p>
      <p><code>./setup.sh</code></p>
      <p>Since the application requires GUI forwarding, the Docker image includes X11 forwarding to display the GUI on your local PC. 
        If you are using a Windows PC, we recommend using PuTTY and Xming for X11 forwarding. Note that X11 forwarding can be slow, 
        so expect some delay after running the program.</p>
      <p>To launch the GUI, run:</p>
      <p><code>./run.sh</code></p>
      <p>You can use this command anytime you want to start the GUI.</p>
    </details>      

    <details> 
      <summary>Can I use <code>setup.sh</code> on any Linux system, including my Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) on my Windows PC?</summary>  
      <p>
        Yes, <code>setup.sh</code> will work on any Linux system as long as your Linux system is properly configured with Docker installed, 
        an X11 environment with <code>DISPLAY</code> set. The shell script loads the Docker image, copy the necessary files to your 
        local directories, and runs the <code>skeb-sniper-container</code>. Note that WSL’s <code>--network host</code> option may not 
        fully replicate native Linux networking behavior, but this will not prevent the script from executing successfully on a 
        properly configured Linux system.
      </p>      
    </details>    

    <details> 
      <summary>Can the program still launch a browser after disconnecting from my Linux server?</summary>  
      <p>Yes. When you use SSH (e.g., with PuTTY), the application's GUI and Firefox use X11 forwarding. If SSH is not active, 
        the GUI will be displayed using Xvfb. So regardless of the scenario, the application will always be able to launch a browser.</p>        
    </details>    

    <details>  
      <summary>Why do I get the error "PuTTY X11 proxy: unable to connect to forwarded X server: Network error: Connection refused" 
        after running <code>setup.sh</code> using PuTTY with X11 forwarding?</summary>  
      <p>If you’ve successfully connected to your Linux server via SSH using PuTTY, make sure that:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>X11 forwarding is enabled on the Linux server.</li>
        <li>Your X server (e.g., Xming) is running on your Windows PC.</li>
        <li>No firewall is blocking the X11 connection.</li>
      </ul>      
      <p>The shell script <code>setup.sh</code> is designed to automatically resolve any xauth mismatch by updating the container's 
        xauth to match the host's.</p>
    </details>    

    <h3>Tips for How to Send A Successful Request</h3>
    <details>
      <summary>Amount</summary>
      <p><strong>Recommended Amount:</strong> If the amount you entered is below the recommended amount, Skeb may prevent the request from being sent. 
        If you are unsure about the recommended amount, you can set a multiplier in the application.</p>
    </details>
    
    <details>
      <summary>Text Validity</summary>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Language and Translation:</strong> Skeb uses automated translation to bridge language barriers between clients and creators. 
        To ensure clarity, compose your request in a straightforward language and avoid idiomatic expressions or complex sentences 
        that may not translate accurately.</li>
        <li><strong>Prohibited Terms:</strong> Certain words or phrases might be flagged by Skeb's system. For example, 
          mentioning "日本語" ("Japanese") in your request may result in rejection, as Skeb does not accept machine 
          translations. Note that Skeb uses DeepL for translation.</li>        
        <li><strong>Clarity and Specificity:</strong> Given that direct communication with creators after sending the request is prohibited by Skeb, 
          it's essential to include all necessary details in your request. Be specific about what you want in the artwork to ensure the final result 
          matches your expectations.</li>
        <li><strong>Character Limit:</strong> Know the maximum character limit set by the artist (usually 1000). 
          Exceeding this limit may result in text truncation when you use the application to send requests.</li>
      </ul>
    </details>
    
    <details>
      <summary>Reference URL</summary>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> If your request includes a reference URL, ensure that the link is publicly 
          accessible. For platforms like Google Drive, set the sharing settings to "Anyone with the link."</li>
        <li><strong>Including Reference URL in your Text:</strong> The reference URL input may not appear on Skeb if your message is too short. 
          Skeb only provides this option when longer text is entered. To ensure your reference URL is included, 
          always include your reference URL in your text.</li>
      </ul>
    </details>
    
    <details>
      <summary>NSFW Content</summary>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>NSFW Setting:</strong> If your request involves NSFW content, make sure to set the NSFW toggle 
          to "On" when entering your request using the application.</li>
        <li><strong>Compliance with Guidelines:</strong> Even with the NSFW toggle enabled, certain extreme or prohibited 
          content may still violate Skeb's Terms of Service. Review <a href="https://lp.skeb.jp/client?locale=en" target="_blank">Skeb's guidelines</a> 
          before submitting.</li>
      </ul>
    </details>
    
    <details>
      <summary>Payment</summary>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Points:</strong> Ensure you have enough Skeb points before submitting a request.  
        The application cannot send requests without sufficient points unless your bank does not require authentication.  
        Using a credit card may trigger 3D authentication, which automation cannot bypass. You can purchase points on Skeb, 
        but be aware that they have an expiration date and may expire if not used.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Credit Cards:</strong> We do not recommend using credit cards, as most banks in America require 
          authentication. Because of this, our automation tool cannot send a request if authentication is required. 
          However, if you are certain that your bank does not require authentication, you can test it on Skeb 
          by attempting to send a request using your credit card. If you are not redirected to 3D authentication, 
          you can use your credit card without needing to purchase points.</li>        
      </ul>     
    </details>
    
    <details>
      <summary>Additional Note</summary>
      <p>Even though we have covered the essential information for using our software, you may still encounter issues when submitting a request.
        If you have more questions on how to use Skeb, you may find the answers on Reddit. For more details on the rules for sending requests 
        on Skeb, please refer to <a href="https://lp.skeb.jp/client?locale=en" target="_blank">Skeb's guidelines</a>.</p>
