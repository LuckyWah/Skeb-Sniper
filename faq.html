    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <details>
      <summary>My Windows PC flags the application as a security concern. Is this application a security threat?</summary>
      <p>No, this happens because Windows does not trust unsigned executables and may flag them as potential malware. 
        The warning appears because our executable lacks a valid certificate authority (CA), 
        which requires a costly certification process that is not necessary for this software. 
        You can manually trust the executable, as it is safe and not malware.</p>          
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>What are the requirements for running this application?</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>Ensure you have sufficient Skeb points for the request or that your bank does not require authentication.
             Otherwise, the program will fail to submit your request.</li>
          <li>Make sure you are using your Gmail account to receive emails from Skeb. 
            If not, update your email to your Gmail account in your Skeb account settings.</li>
          <li>Confirm that you have enabled notifications for the artist. 
            If not, visit the artist's Skeb page and click "Notify on seeking started."</li>
          <li>Test the program and successfully activate the Gmail listener before running the task in the background.</li>
          <li>When running the task in the background, ensure the Gmail listener is activated successfully.</li>
      </ul>

      <summary>Are my Twitter credentials safe?</summary>
      <p>Yes, your Twitter credentials are highly secure because they are encrypted using a machine-specific and user-specific key.
        Our application features enterprise-level security as the encryption key is derived using PBKDF2 with SHA-256 and a 16-byte 
        user-specific salt at each runtime, and this key encrypts your data using AES-128 in CBC mode with HMAC-SHA256 authentication, 
        ensuring that only your user account and your device can decrypt the stored data. This makes any attempt to steal your 
        credentials remotely impossible.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Do you collect any data from us?</summary>
      <p>No, we never collect any data from you, including your Gmail account or Twitter credentials. 
        To protect your privacy, all sensitive data is first encrypted and then securely stored locally on your device. For details, 
        see our Privacy Policy.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>When I try to authenticate using Gmail OAuth, I get a warning that says Google hasn't verified this app. How can I use it?</summary>
      <p>
        Our application requires read-only access to Gmail, which triggers Google's security verification process. Unfortunately, 
        Google mandates a CASA (Cloud Application Security Assessment) verification for applications requesting sensitive scopes, such as 
        the Read-Only scope. CASA verification is a <strong>very costly</strong> security assessment that must be completed annually, 
        and we currently do not have sufficient funds to cover the verification cost.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because of this, our application cannot be verified and Google will always display a warning when you try to use it. To proceed, 
        click on <u>Advanced</u> and select <u>Go to Skeb Sniper (unsafe)</u>. If you want to learn how your data is processed, 
        we encourage you to read our Privacy Policy. If you are not comfortable using our software, you may request a refund. 
        Once the refund is processed, your usage privileges will be revoked.

      <summary>How does this program work?</summary>
      <p>Skeb Sniper is an email driven program, meaning that only when you receive an email from Skeb stating that the artist is open 
        for requests, the program will send a request to the artist.</p>          
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Do I have to input my Twitter credentials?</summary>
      <p>Yes, the program requires your credentials to log in. However, it will first attempt to use cookies. 
        If that fails, it will fall back to using your Twitter credentials.</p>          
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>How do I test the program?</summary>
      <p>You can test the program by clicking on "Test Run." The program will send you an automated email, 
        which will trigger the automation tool to send a request to the artist. 
        We recommend selecting an artist currently open for requests to confirm that the program can log into your account. 
        If login fails, ensure that Two-Factor Authentication is disabled on Twitter. If you prefer not to send a request right now, 
        set the amount to a value below the minimum requirement (e.g., 500). If test run fails, please contact the developer.</p>          
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>What does "Run in Background" in task manager do?</summary>
      <p>You use "Run in Background" when you genuinely want to send a request to the artist. 
        Do <strong>not</strong> use it for testing because no fake email will be sent to you to trigger the automation tool. 
        Automation will only be triggered by the email sent from Skeb. When you click on "Run in Background," 
        the program starts a background process that runs continuously, allowing you to safely disconnect from your server. 
        On Windows, it uses a Windows service, while on Linux, it runs as a daemon managed by supervisord, so you need admin/root privileges to run. 
        The background process automatically shuts down when no tasks are running.</p>          
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>I am running a task for an artist that is currently open in background, but the program does not send a request to the artist. 
        Why is that?</summary>
      <p>Skeb Sniper is an email driven program, so if the artist is currently open, no email will be sent to you from Skeb, 
        thus nothing will trigger the automation tool and no request will be sent. 
        Only use "Run in Background" for artists that are currently closed and ensure that you have reserved email notification from Skeb.</p>          
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>I do not use Gmail to receive emails from Skeb. Can I not use Gmail?</summary>
      <p>Unfortunately, as of now, Skeb Sniper only works with Gmail. Every email API is different and implementing different email APIs 
        requires lots of time and effort. We use Gmail API because it is the most popular choice. If you prefer not using Gmail, 
        this program will not work for you.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>You advertised the application as "sending an instant request." How fast is "instant"?</summary>
      <p>According to the developer's tests, using the "Run in Background" feature (not "Test Run," which may take longer to 
        distinguish scenarios), from the time the artist opens requests on Skeb to the time when the application successfully 
        sends a request, it takes about 8 seconds. However, the response time may vary depending on factors such as server latency 
        on Skeb and Google, computer performance, and other external factors.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Does sending a request through this application guarantee that the artist will accept my commission?</summary>
      <p>No, this application is designed to automatically send a request to the artist, replacing the need for manual submission, 
        so you don’t have to wake up at ungodly hours to send the request yourself. However, whether your request will be accepted 
        depends on the artist and is beyond this program’s control.</p>
