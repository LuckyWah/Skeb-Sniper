      <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> March 14, 2025</p>
      <p>This Privacy Policy describes our policies and procedures on the use of your information 
        when you use the application. It also explains your privacy and how we protect your data. 
        By using the application, you agree to this Privacy Policy.</p>
    
      <h3>Interpretation and Definitions</h3>
    
      <h4>Interpretation</h4>
      <p>Words with capitalized initials have meanings defined under the following conditions. These definitions apply 
        whether the words appear in singular or plural.</p>
    
      <h4>Definitions</h4>
      <p>For the purposes of this Privacy Policy:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Application:</strong> Refers to Skeb Sniper, the software provided by the developer.</li>
        <li><strong>We:</strong> Also referred to as "we," "us," or "our," refers to the developer.</li>
        <li><strong>Data:</strong> Any information that relates to a user.</li>
        <li><strong>You:</strong> The individual accessing or using the application.</li>
      </ul>
    
      <h3>Gmail Data We Access</h3>
      <p>The application requires access to Gmail user data through the Gmail API. We use the Gmail <strong>Read-Only</strong> scope to access 
        the following email information:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>History ID:</strong> Prevents processing old emails by ensuring only emails received after the app starts are accessed.</li>
        <li><strong>Recipient:</strong> Filters out emails intended for others by verifying that the recipient matches your email address, 
          as multiple users may share the same subscription.</li>
        <li><strong>Sender:</strong> Filters emails based on the sender by allowing only those from our predefined list.</li>
        <li><strong>Body:</strong> Retrieves the body of filtered emails for interpretation.</li>
      </ul>   
      <p>We do <strong>not</strong> use any other Google API scopes. Therefore, we do <strong>not</strong> modify, delete, or send emails 
        as it is not permitted in the Read-Only scope.</p>
    
      <h3>How We Use Your Data</h3>
      <p>The application only accesses and processes your Gmail data in <strong>real-time</strong> for the following purposes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Detecting new emails by monitoring Gmail metadata via Pub/Sub notifications.</li>
        <li>Retrieving new emails upon receiving a Pub/Sub notification.</li>
        <li>Filtering out irrelevant emails by checking if the sender is in the predefined list. If not, the email is ignored.</li>
        <li>Extracting the subject and body only from relevant emails.</li>
        <li>Analyzing the email subject and body to interpret its content and categorize it based on the content.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The application does <strong>not</strong> write, store, or transfer your data as the emails are processed in real-time and discarded 
      after the above process is complete.</p>

      <h3>Data Retention and Deletion</h3>
      <p>The application does <strong>not</strong> retain any data, including information about your Gmail account or email contents. 
        All Gmail data is processed in real-time and is <strong>never</strong> stored or transferred. Therefore, data deletion 
        is not applicable.</p>
      <p>If you wish to stop using the application, you can revoke access at any time via your 
        <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/permissions" target="_blank">Google Account settings</a>. 
        Revoking access will immediately prevent our application from accessing your Gmail data.</p>      

      <h3>Gmail Token Protection and Security</h3>
      <p>We prioritize the security of your Gmail account by implementing strict protective measures:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>All API requests comply with Google's OAuth 2.0 authentication protocol.</li>
        <li>We use multi-layer encryption to encrypt your Gmail OAuth token stored on your machine.</li>
        <li>We do <strong>not</strong> store or transfer your Gmail token.</li>
      </ul>    

      <h3>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>
      <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Last updated" date. 
        Users will be notified of significant changes via email or a notice within the application.</p>
    
        <h3>Contact Us</h3>
        <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us via the "Contact Us" tab or directly email the developer at
