      <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> March 14, 2025</p>
      <p>This Privacy Policy describes our policies and procedures on the collection, use, and disclosure of your information 
        when you use the Service. It also explains your privacy rights and how we protect your data. 
        By using the Service, you agree to this Privacy Policy.</p>
    
      <h3>Interpretation and Definitions</h3>
    
      <h4>Interpretation</h4>
      <p>Words with capitalized initials have meanings defined under the following conditions. These definitions apply 
        whether the words appear in singular or plural.</p>
    
      <h4>Definitions</h4>
      <p>For the purposes of this Privacy Policy:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Application:</strong> refers to Skeb Sniper, the software provided by the Company.</li>
        <li><strong>Company:</strong> (referred to as "we," "us," or "our") refers to Skeb Sniper.</li>
        <li><strong>Personal Data:</strong> any information that relates to an identified or identifiable individual.</li>
        <li><strong>Service:</strong> refers to the Application.</li>
        <li><strong>You:</strong> the individual accessing or using the Service.</li>
      </ul>
    
      <h3>Google Data We Access</h3>
      <p>The Application requires access to Google user data through the Gmail API. Specifically, we request the following scope:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Gmail Read-Only Access:</strong> 
          This allows us to retrieve the contents of emails after detecting new emails via Pub/Sub notifications. 
          This scope does not permit modification, deletion, or sending of emails.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We do <strong>not</strong> use any other Google API scopes.</p>
    
      <h3>How We Use Your Data</h3>
      <p>The Application processes your Gmail data strictly for the following purposes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Detecting new emails by monitoring Gmail metadata via Pub/Sub notifications.</li>
        <li>Retrieving new emails upon receiving a Pub/Sub notification.</li>
        <li>Filtering out irrelevant emails by checking if the sender is in the predefined list. If not, the email is ignored.</li>
        <li>Extracting the subject and body only from relevant emails.</li>
        <li>Analyzing the email subject and body to interpret its content and categorize it appropriately.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We do <strong>not</strong> modify, delete, or send emails.</p>

      <h3>Data Retention and Deletion</h3>
      <p>Our application does <strong>not</strong> retain any data, including information about your Gmail account or email contents.</p>
      <p>All Gmail data is processed in real-time and is <strong>never</strong> stored or transferred. 
        Once an email is retrieved and processed, no user data is retained.</p>
      <p>If you wish to stop using the application, you can revoke access at any time via your 
        <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/permissions" target="_blank">Google Account settings</a>. 
        Revoking access will immediately prevent our application from accessing your Gmail data.</p>      

      <h3>Gmail Token Protection and Security</h3>
      <p>We prioritize the security of your Gmail account by implementing strict protective measures:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>All API requests comply with Google's OAuth 2.0 authentication protocol.</li>
        <li>We use multi-layer encryption to encrypt your Gmail OAuth token stored on your machine.</li>
        <li>We do <strong>not</strong> store or transfer your Gmail token.</li>
      </ul>    

      <h3>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>
      <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Last updated" date. 
        Users will be notified of significant changes via email or a notice within the Application.</p>
