                <summary>v1.0 – 12/27/2024</summary>
                <p>This is the initial release of Skeb Sniper, featuring core functionalities including automated 
                    requests and compatibility with Windows servers. A comprehensive tutorial was provided to help 
                    new users get started smoothly, with step-by-step instructions tailored for first-time deployment and use.</p>

            <details>
                <summary>v1.1 – 12/28/2024</summary>
                <p>This update introduced Linux server compatibility and included a new tutorial for using Skeb Sniper 
                    on cloud or remote servers. The update also added a detailed guide titled “Running the Script on 
                    Google Cloud Platform,” making remote deployment more accessible.</p>
            </details>
        
            <details>
                <summary>v1.2 – 12/29/2024</summary>
                <p>Anti-detection features were added to help evade bot detection, including a randomized User-Agent with fallback, 
                    disabled headless mode, tracking protection, and randomized intervals between 5 seconds and 10 minutes. 
                    Stability improvements were also made for remote deployments, and compatibility with GCP and VNC-based GUI setups was verified.</p>
            </details>
        
            <details>
                <summary>v1.3 – 12/30/2024</summary>
                <p>Installation was made significantly easier with dedicated setup scripts for both Windows and Linux. These 
                    improvements were designed for users with limited technical experience, and the updated tutorial became shorter 
                    and more user-friendly.</p>
            </details>
        
            <details>
                <summary>v1.4 – 12/31/2024</summary>
                <p>This version included bug fixes for the Windows setup.bat script and further refined the tutorial to make it more 
                    accessible. Additional security steps were included in the instructions to protect user's Twitter credentials.</p>
            </details>
        
            <details>
                <summary>v1.5 – 01/01/2025</summary>
                <p>A full graphical user interface (GUI) was introduced for Windows, allowing users to securely input Twitter credentials 
                    and commission details through encrypted fields. A log file was also added to track program and commission activity. 
                    Due to the difficulty of GUI forwarding, the Linux version was temporarily discontinued in this release.</p>
            </details>
        
            <details>
                <summary>v1.6 – 01/02/2025</summary>
                <p>The Linux version returned in this release, although it uses the command prompt instead of a GUI. The manual 
                    was improved for both Windows and Linux users. Logging was added for better traceability, and a locking mechanism 
                    was introduced to prevent duplicate requests. This version was verified by the developer to be fully functional, 
                    unlike earlier versions.</p>
            </details>
        
            <details>
                <summary>v1.7 – 01/03/2025</summary>
                <p>Toggle logic was improved to ensure reliable detection of toggle buttons when sending a request on Skeb. The Windows GUI 
                    was updated to include an email input field. Users can now generate multiple artist-specific Python files to monitor 
                    multiple artists in parallel, each file named after the corresponding artist.</p>
            </details>
        
            <details>
                <summary>v1.8 – 01/29/2025</summary>
                <p>This version introduced major improvements to the Windows GUI, allowing users to perform all key tasks from the interface 
                    without referring to the external tutorial. Information is now directly presented within the GUI, making the application 
                    more user-friendly.</p>
            </details>
        
            <details>
                <summary>v1.9 – 03/15/2025</summary>
                <p>Skeb Sniper became an fully event-driven model using Skeb’s email notifications to trigger actions, removing the need 
                    for unethical web scraping. Both Windows and Linux versions became available for distribution after purchase. 
                    The manual and release log is moved to this website.</p>

            <summary>v2</summary>
            <details>
                <summary>v2.0 – 03/26/2025</summary>
                <p>v2.0 introduced a PayPal-powered subscription system with improved license validation. Each user now has a dedicated 
                    email listener to receive Skeb notifications independently, so they will never receive notifications meant for others. 
                    The error-handling system was also improved to provide clearer feedback to the user through the GUI, which helps users 
                    troubleshoot issues more easily.</p>
